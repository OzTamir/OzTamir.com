  <p>
    I'm a student in Tel-Aviv University, in which I learn towards a CS degree. I also learn in Hakfar-Hayarok High school.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a programmer, and there's nothing I like more than a challenge waiting to be solved. I mostly write in Python, but I'm well familiar with most concepts in CS as well as OOP and C-Based languages such as C++, C# and Java.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a part of Hakfar-Hayarok's FIRST robotics team (named GreenBlitz 4590), in which I am part of the Software team; We are in charge for the robot's ability to react to the driver's actions throughout the teleoperated period as well as it's behavior, decision making and Computer-Vision capabilities during the autonomous part of the match.
