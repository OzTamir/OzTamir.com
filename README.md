#### The repo for my personal website, [OzTamir.com] (http://oztamir.com)

Simple, sleek, responsive - just the way I like it.

## Libraries in use:
 - [Twitter's Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/) for HTML and responsiveness across devices.
 - [move.js] (https://github.com/visionmedia/move.js) for the cool effect when clicking one of the social icons.
 - [animate.css] (https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) for the little fade in-out.
 - [Font Awesome] (https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) for the social icons.
